# Tokenizer
standard and basic C program for System Programming class that is just a tokenizer.

## Summary
A C application that simulates a tokenizer, or rather classifying sections of a string of input characters.

## Purpose
The main purpose for its creation was for an assignment in my Systems Programming course at college. This was the first pseudo-application assigned to the class, as it was your introduction to the C language.(I say pseudo-application since we were given a partially-made skeleton of the program and needed to read and write the remaining code that would allow for its functionality.) It mainly serves me today as a remind to how far I have learned since the beginning of my college career.

## Instructions
Run the .c file in your designated IDE. (I used Eclipse back when working on the project)
